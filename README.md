# Tex-Templates

These are the standard templates for the projects and reports at Abertay University.

Fairly self explanatory, divided up by year and by project within the year.

More information on LaTeX including how to use it can be found on [HackSocWiki/LaTeX](https://wiki.hacksoc.co.uk/help-guides/programming-scripting/latex).
