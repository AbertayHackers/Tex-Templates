# Tex-Templates

These are the standard templates for the projects and reports at Abertay University.

Fairly self explanatory, divided up by year and by project within the year.

More information on LaTeX including how to use it can be found on [HackSocWiki/LaTeX](https://hacksoc.co.uk/other/latex).

* Year Three
    * Colin Pentest - Colins Ethical Hacking 2 Module
    * Generic - All other report types for Year 3
* Year Four
    * Dissertation - The Abertay Dissertation style, exactly as specified in the Abertay Style Guide and modelled on the (awful) Word template. Comes complete with comments, a 'Permission to Copy' page, Table of Figures, Table of Tables and a bibliography.
